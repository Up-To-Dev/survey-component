This is a survey-component from which the UpToDev survey is built. The component will not contain the UpToDev survey questions, but will just contain the UI and survey functionality for others to repurpose and use.

<!-- ABOUT THE COMPONENT -->
## About The Component

The survey will consist of one main component. Users will be able to progress and go back through the survey without a page reload. It must be fully responsive and abide by accessibility standards. UpToDev creates user profiles on a large range of topics, interests, careers, etc, and because of this we want to include a range of screens to promote engagement.
